# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

## Description

This is a Node CLI application that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. It passes all of the required tests.


## Notes

It asks different questions based on the role that is selected. The information provided is saved and then inserted dynamically into an HTML webpage. The page can be as short or long as needed and the different roles are shown in different colors.

The tests that were given with the starter code all pass.
